# Triangle-Lake-Resort-Management-System
This project has two parts which are web and java application. The web part is based on asp.net, and java application is implemented by C#. Database of this project is SQL Server. 
Since this project was finished during undergraduate study in China, all of content on the website are in Chinese. I am sorry about that.
